# Flight_Delay_Prediction

In this group school project, we use five years of flight data (31mil flight records) from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and NOAA weather data (630mil records) to predict flight delays. The project was written in databricks with pyspark, pandas and sql.

The datasets were cleaned, analyzed, joined and new features were engineered based on our literature review and insights from our analysis. We also made use of graph algorithms and graph analytics in our study. Finally, we created an ML pipeline of various algorithms to select the best algorithm for our flight delay prediction task.

The slide deck and W261_SP22_FINAL_PROJECT_TEAM14.ipynb report summarizes our findings.

The working ipynb files are as per below:
